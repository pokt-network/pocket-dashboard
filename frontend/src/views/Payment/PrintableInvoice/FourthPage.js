              &quot;<u>Use Restriction</u>&quot; means the requirement that
              Purchaser use all Tokens purchased, as appropriate to Purchaser’s
              intended participation in the Network. If Purchaser is a
              Developer, Purchaser’s Use Restriction requires staking Tokens,
              connecting the Purchaser’s application to the Network and relaying
              data over the Network using the Tokens. If Purchaser is a Node,
              Purchaser must use Tokens by staking Tokens and operating a
              Network node.

            In order to enforce the Use Restriction during the Restricted
            Period, upon purchase of the Tokens in accordance with Section 1.1,
            the Tokens shall be transferred to a digital asset wallet, to which
            the Purchaser maintains the sole private key (the &quot;
            <u>Restricted Wallet</u>&quot;). During the Restricted Period, the
            Company shall place restrictions on the Restricted Wallet to prevent
            Purchaser from transferring Tokens from the Restricted Wallet (the
            &quot;<u>Transfer Restrictions</u>&quot;). Upon the expiration of
            the Restricted Period, the Company shall remove the Transfer
            Restrictions from the Restricted Wallet.
