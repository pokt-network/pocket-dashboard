              Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that this agreement to purchase
              cannot be withdrawn, terminated, or revoked. This agreement to
              purchase shall be binding on the heirs, executors, administrators,
              successors and assigns of Purchaser. This agreement to purchase is
              not transferable or assignable by Purchaser, except as expressly
              provided in the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

              The Company has provided specific procedures on how Purchaser may
              seek to purchase Tokens through the Purchasing Site. By purchasing
              Tokens, Purchaser acknowledges, agrees to, and has no objection to
              such procedures and specifications. Purchaser further acknowledges
              and agrees that failure to properly use the Purchasing Site and
              follow such procedures, including the submission of all required
              documentation, may result in a rejection of Purchaser’s agreement
              to purchase and Purchaser not receiving any Tokens. Unauthorized
              access or use of the Purchasing Site or the receipt or purchase of
              Tokens pursuant to this Agreement through any other means are not
              sanctioned or agreed to in any way by the Company. Purchaser
              should take great care to verify the accuracy of the universal
              resource locator for the Purchasing Site used to purchase Tokens.
